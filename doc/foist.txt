Vim's builtin line-completion requires that the partial text match the
start of candidate lines, forcing users to remember the start of the
lines they have in mind rather than being able to match any lines
containing the partial text anywhere within the line.

Foist solves that problem by providing whole line completion based on
partials matching any text therein. Foist searches all loaded buffers
for candidates matching the supplied partial.
